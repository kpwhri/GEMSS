          It's important not to have cigarettes hanging around on or after your
          Quit Date, so plan your purchases wisely! Buy them by the pack, not
          the carton.

          Tell someone
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <mat-panel-description>
        <p>
          Now that you've decided to stop smoking and you've gotten your
          medication, it's time to tell someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know, that sounds scary. You don't have to tell everyone, but tell
          one person you trust. It's easier to quit if you have support from a
          good friend or family member.
        </p>
        <p>The support person is someone who:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you trust</li>
          <li>
            will support you, even when you're cranky and not your best, or
          </li>
          <li>has made a hard change for themselves in the past</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Don't choose someone who currently smokes. It will be harder for them
          to support you when they are not ready to quit smoking.

            Call, text or email daily to check in after your Quit Date,
            especially after the first couple weeks

          Many people think quitting smoking is a matter of willpower: if you
          want it badly enough, you can will it to happen. Wrong!
        </p>
        <p>Quitting smoking is about <b>skill-power</b>, not will-power!</p>

        Clean house
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <mat-panel-description>
      <p>
        Cleaning house is a good thing to do 1&ndash;2 days before your Quit
        Date. Get rid of everything that reminds you of smoking so you can start
        with a clean slate the morning of your quit date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wash your sheets, clothes, curtains, carpets &mdash; anything that
        smells like smoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empty all of your ashtrays and start putting them away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open the windows in your home and car and let the fresh air in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Round up any remaining cigarettes and put them in one place. Be sure to
        check drawers, pockets, briefcases or backpacks &mdash; anywhere you may
        have stashed a pack or some singles for safe keeping.

        Final preparation
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <mat-panel-description>
      <p>
        Here's what you need to do the day before your Quit Date:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Review your checklist &mdash; have you forgotten anything?
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you have your stop-smoking medicine. Put it in the bathroom
          or on the kitchen table where you will see it <i>first thing</i> in
          the morning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get rid of any cigarettes you still have. Throw them out! It's easy to
          slip or relapse if you have cigarettes hanging around, but it's very
          hard to slip if you don't.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plan something fun for your Quit Date that doesn't require a lot of
          mental energy &mdash; go to a movie, go shopping, take a walk with a
          friend. Choose an activity you enjoy, but one that won't make smoking
          easy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to bed early, so you can get a good night's sleep.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now you are ready for step 5!</p>
